# Maze-Solver
Python program that illustrates different search algorithms on an interactive grid.

Do use this program you must have the numpy, math, pygame, and queue libraries.

The maze is represented on a grid displayed by the program.

The user can place the start and stop location aswell as put walls in the maze by left clicking.

To start the user must first place the start position identified by a blue square.

Then the user must place the end position identified by a yellow square.

Then the user may click squares to make them into black walls.

The user may remove placed squares by right clicking them.

Once set up the user can press b to do breadth first search, d to do depth first search, and a to to a star search.

The search will be illustrated by red squares and the path to the finish from the start will be illustrated with purple squares.

After running your algorithm you can reset the search results by clicking r and clear the maze by clicking c.

If you want to adjust the grid size edit and dimensions of the app edit the WIDTH variable at the top
of maze.py and the rows variable at the top of the main funciton.
